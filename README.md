This repository contains all the code and files used for the creation and evaluation of __SHADE__ (SHAring DEvice), a collection of WhatsApp-shared images coming from different types of physical devices and software interfaces. The aim is to move the first steps toward the unexplored task of identifying the device type and operating system from which a media content has been uploaded. This database provides the forensic community with a new asset for investigating the peculiar artifacts introduced by different sharing modes, and for validating detection algorithms. SHADE is available for download [here](https://mmlab.disi.unitn.it/resources/published-datasets).
