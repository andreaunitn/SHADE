This repository contains all the code and files used for the creation and evaluation of SHADE, a collection of WhatsApp-shared images coming from different types of physical devices and software interfaces. The aim is to move the first steps toward the unexplored task of identifying the device type and operating system from which a media content has been uploaded. In fact, widely used messaging platforms, like WhatsApp and Telegram, provide multiple different user interfaces: mobile apps, desktop apps and browser apps. Each installed version (mobile or desktop) is compiled for the specific operating system (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows), and different systems often use different web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari). Therefore, it could be the case that different interfaces of a same platform leave peculiar traces on uploaded images and videos. To verify this hypothesis SHADE has been created and is available to all researchers or interested people [here](https://mmlab.disi.unitn.it/resources/published-datasets).
